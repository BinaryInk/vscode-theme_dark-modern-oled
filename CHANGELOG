# Changelog

## v0.1.2 (2023-08-10)

- Changed the display name of the theme. Missed it when I was renaming the
extension prior to publishing. Better matches the default naming scheme.
  - "VS Code Modern Dark (OLED)" -> "Dark Modern (OLED Black)"
- Lowered the version requirement, as I can confirm it runs on a lower version
than initially specified...
- Added disclaimer to the README regarding the use of the term "OLED" and how
this is not designed to reduce burn-in, moved picture to own directory.

## v0.1.0 (2023-08-10)

Initial release.
