# Changelog
# 1.3.7 (2025-01-21)
  - Fixed foreground color of git branch labels in the git panel.

# 1.3.6 (2024-11-08)
  - Swapped primary and secondary button styles (The blue foreground on the secondary style felt confusing, as it seemed to indicate it was the primary button).

# 1.3.5 (2024-10-20)
  I missed a background entry & I don't think my synchronization between desktop & laptop happened prior to pushing out package to marketplace (thus, 1.3.4 didn't actually change anything).

  - *Active* Activity background now also black.

# 1.3.4 (2024-10-20)
  TL;DR: I probably should have slept on the changes I made yesterday instead of pushing them out the door. 
  
  I want to make a more VSCode (i.e., #41aafa) accent-heavy variant in the future, and an accent variant that incorporates more of the Visual Studio aesthetic (i.e., purple, some of the syntax highlighting colors). I jumped the gun on that yesterday and came to the realization that I should preserve a more reserved and subtle approach to the existing theme, and give myself a little time to better design a more flashy variant... With that in mind and with this change, the main 'Dark Modern OLED' will remain a more subtle and conservative take on the Modern Dark theme. With this overhaul, I don't anticipate needing to change anything in the future.

  I'll be addressing the other variants in 1.4, and possibly introduce the aforementioned accent-heavy variant and VS variant(s).

  ---

  - Reverted various changes from 1.3.2 & 1.3.3 and overall made the appearance more subtle. Using fewer explicit colors and relying on defaults, which improves consistency and editability in the future.
    - Highlighted borders in accent color are used more sparingly, typically only for focus or selection.
      - Widgets and other pop-out borders are typically #444 instead of bright blue.
    - Standardized colors:
      - #000
      - #222
      - #444
      - #666
      - #888
      - #aaa
      - #ccc
      - #fff
      - #41aafa (Accent)
      - #ea6c13 (Debug & Modified Tab Border)
      - There are a few outliers, but for the most part, every element I've changed are now using those colors for consistency.
  - Status bar colors:
    - Dim white when no workspace is open
    - Brighter white when workspace is open instead of accent.
    - Accent now used for hover
    - Very dim border introduced. (I don't want most of the UI to have any border, but it makes sense here and looks good overall).
  - Line numbers are now dimmer.
  - Tabs now have hover, a slight border on selection, and a more prominent border at the end of pins.
  - Text selections are now grey. Most hovers are now grey.
  - *Actually* fixed a few things that somehow didn't get included in 1.3.3 and 1.3.2 (e.g., terminal cursor colors).
  - Changed the Activity Bar background to #000 again. Hadn't realized changing it to 'default' made it non-#000, thought it would inherit from the panel.
  - Changed Activity Bar foreground to white.

# 1.3.3 (2024-10-19)
  - Fixed two selection instances where the foreground and background were the same color
  - Changed the tab bar selected & modified border colors.
  - Changed terminal cursor colors.

# 1.3.2 (2024-10-19)
  - Darker selection background color
  - Revised Modern Dark OLED.
    - Changed buttons and other elements to use black backgrounds with blue foreground and/or blue outlines.
    - Changed some selections to be colored.
    - Made any background that wasn't already black that should've been (e.g., tooltips)
    - Other minor tweaks
  - Defaults now made explicit in JSON.

# 1.3.1 (2024-05-01)
